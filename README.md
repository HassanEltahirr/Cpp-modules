# Cpp-modules

The C++ modules at 42 (the coding school) are designed to help students learn and master key programming concepts in C++ through hands-on projects. Each module typically focuses on a specific aspect of C++ and builds upon the skills learned in previous modules. Here's a brief description of the core modules:

1. C++01 - C++ Basics
Focus: Introduction to C++ syntax, basic data types, control structures (if, loops), functions, and basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
Objective: To get comfortable with the C++ language and its features, and understand the fundamentals of writing C++ code.
2. C++02 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Focus: In-depth study of object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
Objective: To understand how to design and implement classes, use inheritance, and apply OOP principles in real-world applications.
3. C++03 - Advanced OOP & Memory Management
Focus: Further exploration of OOP concepts like operator overloading, friend functions, and virtual functions. Introduction to memory management, including dynamic memory allocation and pointers.
Objective: To gain a deeper understanding of advanced OOP techniques and manage memory effectively in C++.
4. C++04 - Templates and Exception Handling
Focus: Understanding C++ templates (function and class templates) and exception handling (try, catch, throw).
Objective: To learn how to write generic code using templates and handle errors in a structured way using exceptions.
5. C++05 - Standard Template Library (STL)
Focus: Introduction to the STL, including containers (vectors, lists, maps), iterators, algorithms, and more.
Objective: To effectively use the STL to simplify code and increase productivity by leveraging built-in data structures and algorithms.
6. C++06 - Advanced C++ and Design Patterns
Focus: Advanced C++ topics such as smart pointers, move semantics, and the use of design patterns in C++ programming.
Objective: To master advanced C++ features and apply common design patterns to solve complex problems efficiently.
7. C++07 - Project Work and Optimization
Focus: Students work on large-scale projects to apply the knowledge gained in previous modules, focusing on performance optimization, code readability, and problem-solving.
Objective: To integrate all C++ concepts into a complete project, while focusing on clean, optimized, and maintainable code.
